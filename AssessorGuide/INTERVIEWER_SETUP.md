# Interviewer Setup Guide

This guide helps you prepare the Azure-deployed technical assessment environment before the interview.

**Important:** This assessment runs entirely in Azure with automated CI/CD pipelines. Candidates will diagnose and fix issues in the deployed environment, then verify fixes via the pipelines.

## Prerequisites

### Required Access
- [ ] Active Azure subscription with Contributor access
- [ ] GitHub repository (forked or cloned) with Actions enabled
- [ ] Azure CLI (`az`) installed locally for setup
- [ ] Git installed locally

### Candidate Requirements
- [ ] GitHub account (to access candidate fork)
- [ ] Web browser (for Azure Portal and deployed apps)
- [ ] Code editor (VS Code or similar) for making fixes
- [ ] Basic familiarity with Git commands

---

## Pre-Interview Setup

**Estimated Time:** 45-60 minutes (first-time setup)

**Overview:** You'll create Azure infrastructure, configure GitHub Actions, deploy the application with intentional bugs, and verify the pipelines work. Candidates will then fix bugs and redeploy via the same pipelines.

### 1. Fork Repository for Candidate

```powershell
# Clone the assessor repository
git clone <assessor-repository-url>
cd TFL-DevOps-Test

# Remove the AssessorGuide folder
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force AssessorGuide

# Create candidate repository (via GitHub UI or CLI)
# Push to new repository
git remote set-url origin <candidate-repository-url>
git push -u origin main
```

**Or use GitHub's fork feature and then delete the `AssessorGuide/` folder.**

---

## Azure Infrastructure Setup

### 2. Create Azure Resource Group

```powershell
# Login to Azure
az login

# Set your subscription (if you have multiple)
az account set --subscription "<your-subscription-id>"

# Create resource group
az group create `
  --name "rg-tfl-school-dev" `
  --location "uksouth"
```

**Note:** Update the resource group name in `.github/workflows/Infrastructure.yml` if using a different name.

### 3. Create User-Assigned Managed Identity

```powershell
# Create the managed identity
az identity create `
  --name "id-tfl-school-github" `
  --resource-group "rg-tfl-school-dev" `
  --location "uksouth"

# Get the Client ID (Application ID)
$clientId = az identity show `
  --name "id-tfl-school-github" `
  --resource-group "rg-tfl-school-dev" `
  --query clientId -o tsv

# Get the Principal ID
$principalId = az identity show `
  --name "id-tfl-school-github" `
  --resource-group "rg-tfl-school-dev" `
  --query principalId -o tsv

Write-Host "Client ID: $clientId"
Write-Host "Principal ID: $principalId"
```

### 4. Assign Permissions to Managed Identity

```powershell
# Get your subscription ID
$subscriptionId = az account show --query id -o tsv

# Assign Contributor role at Resource Group level
az role assignment create `
  --assignee $principalId `
  --role "Contributor" `
  --scope "/subscriptions/$subscriptionId/resourceGroups/rg-tfl-school-dev"

# If deploying across subscription, use subscription scope instead:
# --scope "/subscriptions/$subscriptionId"
```

### 5. Configure Federated Credentials for GitHub Actions

```powershell
# For main branch deployments
az identity federated-credential create `
  --name "github-main-branch" `
  --identity-name "id-tfl-school-github" `
  --resource-group "rg-tfl-school-dev" `
  --issuer "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com" `
  --subject "repo:<GitHubOrg>/<RepoName>:ref:refs/heads/main" `
  --audiences "api://AzureADTokenExchange"

# For pull request deployments (optional)
az identity federated-credential create `
  --name "github-pull-requests" `
  --identity-name "id-tfl-school-github" `
  --resource-group "rg-tfl-school-dev" `
  --issuer "https://token.actions.githubusercontent.com" `
  --subject "repo:<GitHubOrg>/<RepoName>:pull_request" `
  --audiences "api://AzureADTokenExchange"
```

**Replace:** `<GitHubOrg>/<RepoName>` with your actual GitHub organization and repository (e.g., `TransportForLondon/TFL-DevOps-Test`)

### 6. Add GitHub Secrets

Navigate to your GitHub repository → **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions**

#### Required Secrets:
```powershell
# AZURE_CREDENTIALS (JSON format for service principal)
{
  "clientId": "<client-id-from-step-3>",
  "clientSecret": "",
  "subscriptionId": "<your-subscription-id>",
  "tenantId": "<your-tenant-id>",
  "resourceManagerEndpointUrl": "https://management.azure.com/"
}

# SQL_ADMIN_PASSWORD
# Generate a strong password for SQL Server admin
# Example: 'P@ssw0rd123!' (use something more secure)

# APP_USER_PASSWORD  
# Generate a strong password for the application database user
# Example: 'AppU$er456!' (use something more secure)
```

**To get your Tenant ID:**
```powershell
az account show --query tenantId -o tsv
```

#### Required Variables (not secrets):
- `APP_INSIGHTS_CONN_STRING` - (will be created after infrastructure deployment)
- `API_NAME` - Name of the API app service (from infrastructure output)
- `STUDENTPORTAL_NAME` - Name of the portal app service (from infrastructure output)

### 7. Deploy Infrastructure

```powershell
cd src/Infrastructure

# Review and update main.parameters.json if needed
# Then deploy using Azure CLI

az deployment group create `
  --resource-group "rg-tfl-school-dev" `
  --template-file main.bicep `
  --parameters main.parameters.json `
  --parameters environmentName=dev `
              sqlAdminPassword='<your-sql-admin-password>' `
              appUserPassword='<your-app-user-password>'
```

**Or trigger via GitHub Actions:**
- Push changes to `src/Infrastructure/**` on main branch
- Or manually trigger the "Deploy Infrastructure" workflow

### 8. Get Infrastructure Outputs and Update Configuration

After infrastructure deployment, retrieve the outputs:

```powershell
# Get the deployment outputs
az deployment group show `
  --resource-group "rg-tfl-school-dev" `
  --name "school-infra-deployment" `
  --query properties.outputs

# Key outputs you need:
# - sqlServerName: e.g., "sql-tfls-abc123xyz.database.windows.net"
# - databaseName: e.g., "sqldb-tfls-abc123xyz"
# - apiAppName: e.g., "app-api-tfls-abc123xyz"
# - portalAppName: e.g., "app-portal-tfls-abc123xyz"
# - appInsightsConnectionString
```

### 9. Update Application Configuration Files

**Update `src/Api/appsettings.json`:**
```json
{
  "DatabaseConnection": {
    "DatabaseName": "sqldb-tfls-<WRONG-NAME>",  // ⚠️ Keep this WRONG for Bug #1
    "UserName": "appUser",
    "Password": ""
  }
}
```

**Update `src/Api/appsettings.Development.json`:**
```json
{
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "TflSchoolApiContext": "Server=tcp:<sql-server-name>.database.windows.net,1433;Initial Catalog=<database-name>;Persist Security Info=False;User ID=sqlAdmin;Password=<SQL_ADMIN_PASSWORD>;MultipleActiveResultSets=False;Encrypt=True;TrustServerCertificate=False;Connection Timeout=30;"
  }
}
```

**Important for Assessment:**
- In `appsettings.json`, the `DatabaseName` should have a typo (e.g., missing last character)
- In `appsettings.Development.json`, the full connection string should be correct
- This creates Bug #1 for candidates to diagnose

### 10. Initialize Database Schema

```powershell
cd src/Api

# Run migrations to create database schema
dotnet ef database update --connection "<your-connection-string-from-appsettings.Development.json>"

# Or use Azure CLI
# The migrations will run automatically on first API deployment via GitHub Actions
```

### 11. Seed Sample Data

The database must have student "Carson Alexander" with 3 enrollments totaling 9 credits for Question 2.

```sql
-- Connect to your Azure SQL Database and run:

-- Insert sample data (adjust as needed)
INSERT INTO Students (FirstMidName, LastName, EnrollmentDate) 
VALUES ('Carson', 'Alexander', '2019-09-01');

-- Get the student ID
DECLARE @StudentId INT = SCOPE_IDENTITY();

-- Insert courses
INSERT INTO Courses (CourseId, Title, Credits, DepartmentId) VALUES 
(1050, 'Chemistry', 3, 1),
(4022, 'Microeconomics', 3, 2),
(4041, 'Macroeconomics', 3, 2);

-- Insert enrollments
INSERT INTO Enrollments (CourseId, StudentId, Grade) VALUES 
(1050, @StudentId, NULL),
(4022, @StudentId, NULL),
(4041, @StudentId, NULL);
```

**Verify:**
```sql
SELECT s.FirstMidName, s.LastName, c.Title, c.Credits
FROM Students s
JOIN Enrollments e ON s.Id = e.StudentId
JOIN Courses c ON e.CourseId = c.CourseId
WHERE s.FirstMidName = 'Carson' AND s.LastName = 'Alexander';

-- Should return 3 rows totaling 9 credits
```

### 12. Update GitHub Variables

Add these to **Settings** → **Secrets and variables** → **Actions** → **Variables**:

```
APP_INSIGHTS_CONN_STRING = <from infrastructure outputs>
API_NAME = <api-app-name from outputs>
STUDENTPORTAL_NAME = <portal-app-name from outputs>
```

### 13. Verify All Three Bugs Are Present

Before the interview, confirm the bugs are in place:

#### Bug 1 (API Configuration):
```powershell
# Check appsettings.json has typo in database name
cat src/Api/appsettings.json | Select-String "DatabaseName"
# Should show a database name with a typo (e.g., missing last character)
```

#### Bug 2 (C# Logic):
```powershell
# Check Student.cs has assignment instead of accumulation
cat src/Models/Models/Student.cs | Select-String "totalCredits ="
# Should show: totalCredits = (int)enrollment.Course.Credits;
# (using = instead of +=)
```

#### Bug 3 (PowerShell):
```powershell
# Check DataUpload.ps1 overwrites $value instead of accumulating
cat src/DataUpload/Enrollment2024/DataUpload.ps1 | Select-String '$value ='
# Should show: $value = "(...)"
# (not $values += "(...)")
```

### 14. Test Deployment Pipelines

Verify all GitHub Actions workflows complete successfully:

```powershell
# Push a small change to trigger pipelines
cd src/Api
# Make a trivial change (e.g., add a comment)
git add .
git commit -m "Test pipeline"
git push origin main
```

**Check GitHub Actions:**
- Navigate to **Actions** tab in GitHub
- Verify "Build and Deploy API" workflow runs successfully
- Verify "Build and Deploy StudentPortal" workflow runs successfully
- Check deployed URLs are accessible

### 15. Verify Deployed Applications

#### API Endpoint:
```
https://<api-app-name>.azurewebsites.net/api/Students
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- If Bug #1 NOT fixed: Returns 500 error (database connection fails)
- If Bug #1 fixed: Returns JSON array of students

#### Student Portal:
```
https://<portal-app-name>.azurewebsites.net
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- Site loads successfully
- Search for "Carson Alexander"
- If Bug #2 NOT fixed: Shows 3 credits
- If Bug #2 fixed: Shows 9 credits

### 16. Verify Application Insights

Navigate to Azure Portal → Application Insights resource

**Check:**
- [ ] Live metrics are showing (app is sending telemetry)
- [ ] Failures section shows errors if Bug #1 is present
- [ ] Logs contain connection errors for candidates to diagnose

### 17. Prepare PowerShell Upload Test Data

Ensure CSV files exist in `src/DataUpload/Enrollment2024/`:
- `Students.csv` - Should have 4+ student records
- `Enrollments.csv` - Enrollment data

**For Question 3 testing:**
Candidates will run the PowerShell script from their local machine or Azure Cloud Shell, pointing to the Azure SQL Database.

## During the Interview

### Introduction (5 minutes)
1. Welcome the candidate
2. Explain the assessment format (3 questions, 60 minutes)
3. Provide access:
   - GitHub repository URL (candidate fork)
   - Azure Portal URL (read-only access recommended)
   - Deployed application URLs
   - Database connection details for Question 3
4. Confirm they can access the resources
5. Start the timer

### Candidate Workflow
Candidates will:
1. **Diagnose** issues using Azure Portal, Application Insights, and deployed application
2. **Fix** bugs by editing code in the GitHub repository
3. **Commit and push** changes to trigger GitHub Actions pipelines
4. **Verify** fixes by checking the deployed application after pipeline completes

### Monitoring Progress
- **0-20 min:** Question 1 - Should be diagnosing API failure in Application Insights
- **20-40 min:** Question 2 - Should be fixing C# code and watching pipeline deploy
- **40-60 min:** Question 3 - Should be fixing PowerShell script
- **Check pipelines:** Monitor their GitHub Actions runs for progress

### What to Observe
- [ ] Do they use Application Insights to diagnose Q1?
- [ ] Do they understand the pipeline logs and deployment process?
- [ ] Do they test changes by visiting the deployed URLs?
- [ ] Do they wait for pipelines to complete before verifying?
- [ ] How do they handle pipeline failures (if any)?

### What to Provide
**DO provide:**
- Azure Portal credentials (read-only viewer role)
- Deployed application URLs
- SQL Server connection details for Question 3
- GitHub repository access

**DON'T provide:**
- Hints about where the bugs are
- Direct access to fix Azure resources
- Solutions or code snippets

### Common Issues

#### "The API is returning 500 errors"
- This is Question 1! They should use Application Insights to diagnose
- Point them to the Failures blade in App Insights if they're stuck

#### "My pipeline is failing"
- Check if they broke the build with syntax errors
- If it's a legitimate build break, that's part of their learning
- Only help if it's an infrastructure issue (secrets missing, etc.)

#### "How do I test my fix?"
- They should wait for the GitHub Actions pipeline to complete
- Then visit the deployed application URL
- For Q3, they run the PowerShell script locally against Azure SQL

#### "I don't have PowerShell / SQL tools"
- Provide Azure Cloud Shell access for running the PowerShell script
- Or allow them to just fix the code and explain the solution

## Post-Interview

### Scoring
Refer to `SOLUTIONS.md` for:
- Expected solutions
- Scoring criteria
- Red flags

### Debrief Questions
1. "Walk me through how you diagnosed Question 1"
2. "What was the bug in Question 2, and how did you find it?"
3. "What would you do differently with more time?"
4. "How would you prevent these bugs in production?"

---

## Troubleshooting

### The bugs have been fixed in the repo!
```powershell
# Reset to original buggy state
git checkout main
git reset --hard origin/main

# Or restore specific files
git checkout origin/main -- src/Api/appsettings.json
git checkout origin/main -- src/Models/Models/Student.cs
git checkout origin/main -- src/DataUpload/Enrollment2024/DataUpload.ps1

# Force redeploy
git commit --allow-empty -m "Redeploy buggy version"
git push origin main
```

### Pipeline is failing unexpectedly
- Check GitHub Secrets are configured correctly
- Verify Azure credentials haven't expired
- Check resource group and resources still exist
- Review workflow logs in GitHub Actions

### Application Insights not showing data
- Check connection string is configured in GitHub Variables
- Verify the app is actually running (visit URL)
- Wait 2-5 minutes for data to appear
- Check the Application Insights resource exists in Azure

### Candidate finished too quickly (< 30 minutes)
- Verify all bugs are actually fixed by checking deployed apps
- Check their git commits show proper fixes
- Ask them to add monitoring/alerting improvements
- Discuss how they would prevent these bugs in production

### Candidate is stuck (> 45 minutes on one question)
- Give a hint: "Have you checked Application Insights?" or "What do the pipeline logs show?"
- Suggest they move to the next question and come back
- Consider extending time if infrastructure issues consumed time

---

## Alternative Formats

### Remote Interview (Recommended)
- Share screen while candidate drives
- Watch them navigate Azure Portal and Application Insights
- Observe their git workflow and pipeline monitoring
- Great for seeing real-time problem solving

### Take-Home Assessment
- Provide repository fork and Azure access for 24-48 hours
- Ask for PR with fixes and explanation
- Schedule follow-up to discuss approach and decisions
- Good for candidates in different time zones

### Pair Programming / Live
- Work through issues together in real-time
- Observe thought process as they diagnose
- Ask probing questions during investigation
- Best for evaluating collaboration skills
